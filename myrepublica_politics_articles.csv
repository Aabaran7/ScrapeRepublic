 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The Communist Party of Nepal (UML) has introduced a rule prohibiting the formation of panels in election during the party convention. According to the party’s newly released 'Annual Action Plan for Decisive National Strength Building,' candidates running for any committee position must present themselves individually to voters without forming or promoting any panels.
The action plan, unveiled by General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, outlines a goal of reaching 1 million members by the party's upcoming 11th Convention. Membership expansion will focus on mass organizations and contact platforms.
Additionally, the party plans to implement an online system for membership documentation and mandates basic training for all new and current party members. Party membership cards will be issued by district committees based on demand.
Committees that fail to hold sessions within the period stipulated by the party statute will automatically be converted into organizational committees. Moreover, those with financial arrears to the party will be barred from running for positions in conventions and elected bodies.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The Parliamentary Hearings Committee (PHC) has approved the names of 16 out of 17 proposed ambassadors for various countries, as submitted by the government.
In a meeting held at Singha Durbar on Thursday, the committee endorsed the names of 16 ambassadors by a majority vote, out of the 17 proposed candidates.
Committee Chairperson Ishwari Devi Neupane announced that the decision was made after considering complaints from petitioners, the clarifications of the proposed ambassadors, their work plans, and their statements.
The committee approved 16 ambassadors by majority vote. However, some documents related to the proposed ambassador for Sri Lanka, Ram Krishna Bhattarai, were found to be incomplete. Therefore, the committee has directed the secretariat to request additional documents.
Neupane mentioned that Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmaker Dol Prasad Aryal expressed differing opinions on the proposed ambassadors for Israel, Prof Dhan Prasad Pandit; South Africa, Prof Dr Kapil Shrestha; and Malaysia, Dr Netra Prasad Timalsina.
Likewise, Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari had differing views regarding the proposed ambassador to India, Shankar Sharma.
In the case of Pandit, a legal matter is pending in the Supreme Court. Aryal argued that Shrestha cannot be appointed ambassador due to a constitutional provision prohibiting individuals who have served as members of the National Human Rights Commission from holding other government positions. In the case of Timalsina, he has filed a case in the Supreme Court against the government.
Shrestha was a member of the National Human Rights Commission from 2057 BS to 2062 BS, while Pandit has been convicted by the Patan High Court. Regarding Sharma, concerns were raised about the guidelines for ambassadorial appointments, which prohibit consecutive terms. Sharma was appointed ambassador to India in Chaitra 2078 but was recalled before completing his tenure by the previous government.
Of the four proposed ambassadors who have courted controversy, Sharma, Shrestha, and Pandit represent the Nepali Congress, while Timalsina is from the UML quota. Chitralekha Yadav has been recommended ambassador under the Madhesi woman quota and Sewa Lamsal from the Foreign Service.
The cabinet meeting on Shrawan 14 (July 29) recommended new ambassadors for various countries. Dr Shankar Prasad Sharma was nominated for India, Kanta Rijal for Australia, and Naresh Bikram Dhakal for Saudi Arabia. Other recommendations included Prof Dr Kapil Man Shrestha for South Africa, Prof  Dhan Prasad Pandit for Israel, and Ram Krishna Bhattarai for Sri Lanka. Shanil Nepal was proposed for Spain, Dr Shail Rupakheti for Germany, and Lok Darshan Regmi for the USA. Chandra Kumar Ghimire was nominated for the UK, while Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe was selected for South Korea. Janga Bahadur Chauhan was recommended for Russia, Ramesh Chandra Paudel for Qatar, and Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli for China. Sumnina Tuladhar was recommended ambassador for Denmark, Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina for Malaysia, and Prakash Mani Paudel for Portugal. Likewise, Rita Dhital was recommended for Pakistan.
There is a constitutional provision for the president to appoint the ambassadors after approval by the parliamentary committee.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The family dispute of Chandrakant (CK) Raut, the chairman of the Janamat Party, has reached its peak. Despite Raut filing for divorce from his wife Soni Sindhu Rani, the conflict between the couple remains unresolved.
Both individuals have approached the police, claiming to feel unsafe due to each other. According to the Lalitpur police, Raut visited the Imadol Police Sector a few days ago, requesting peace and security due to feeling unsafe from his wife, Rani.
On Thursday, Raut's wife Rani also went to the Satdobato Police Circle, requesting protection and claiming to feel unsafe due to her husband. However, the police have not yet registered her complaint. “She (Rani) went to the Satdobato Police Circle claiming insecurity from her husband,” said a Lalitpur police source. “The complaint has not yet been registered, but she is in contact with DSP Chitra Bhattarai at the station.”
Police said that the case is currently under consideration. 
Raut filed for divorce from his wife Rani at the Lalitpur District Court on August 28 under the title “Partition and Divorce.”
Raut, who resides in Mahalakshmi Municipality-4 in Lalitpur, filed for divorce due to marital discord. The complaint alleges that his wife frequently visited her parental home and that their relationship had become strained, among other issues, according to Spokesperson Ram Sajiwan Mahato of the court.
“Raut has stated in the divorce petition that his wife repeatedly asked for a divorce and even attempted suicide to pressure him into it,” Mahato said.
The couple has two daughters and one son, and Raut has requested custody of the children. 
Raut's wife Rani is from Simriya Ghat in Bihar, India.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Arzu Rana Deuba, has urged the Canadian government to establish an embassy in Nepal. She made this request during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly on Wednesday in Ottawa, Canada.
“The number of Nepali students going to Canada for studies has been increasing day by day, and the number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal is also on the rise,” she said. “Similarly, researchers, businesspersons, and other citizens from various sectors of both countries are increasingly exchanging visits. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, and I would like to make this request.”
Minister Rana also emphasized the need for Canada to consider establishing its embassy in a democratic country like Nepal, situated between two large Asian nations, during her discussion with Foreign Minister Joly.
The meeting covered various aspects of Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, and concerns, as well as topics such as economic investment and partnership.
During the conversation, both ministers highlighted the cordial relations between the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1965. Nepal and Canada will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship next year.
Minister Rana also appreciated Canada's support in Nepal's democratic process and the drafting of the current Constitution.
She informed that Nepal's parliament recently passed the transitional justice law, which will help complete the remaining tasks of the peace process.
On that occasion, Minister Rana recalled Canada's long-standing economic aid and development support to Nepal in various sectors under different titles.

Canada KATHMANDU, Sept 19: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Arzu Rana Deuba, has urged the Canadian government to establish an embassy in Nepal. She made this request during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly on Wednesday in Ottawa, Canada. “The number of Nepali students going to Canada for studies has been increasing day by day, and the number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal is also on the rise,” she said. “Similarly, researchers, businesspersons, and other citizens from various sectors of both countries are increasingly exchanging visits. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, and I would like to make this request.” Minister Rana also emphasized the need for Canada to consider establishing its embassy in a democratic country like Nepal, situated between two large Asian nations, during her discussion with Foreign Minister Joly. The meeting covered various aspects of Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, and concerns, as well as topics such as economic investment and partnership. During the conversation, both ministers highlighted the cordial relations between the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1965. Nepal and Canada will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship next year. Minister Rana also appreciated Canada's support in Nepal's democratic process and the drafting of the current Constitution. She informed that Nepal's parliament recently passed the transitional justice law, which will help complete the remaining tasks of the peace process. On that occasion, Minister Rana recalled Canada's long-standing economic aid and development support to Nepal in various sectors under different titles. Currently, Minister Rana is in Canada on a visit at the invitation of Canadian Minister Joly. She is scheduled to attend the Meeting of Women Foreign Ministers, which will be held on 19-20 September in Toronto. She had left for Canada on Monday evening.

                                                                                            By: Tapendra Karki KATHMANDU, Sept 18: The report of the parliamentary special committee investigating the misuse of cooperative funds is now set to test Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, who plays a crucial role in its implementation. Previously, as the chief whip of the Nepali Congress (NC) in opposition, Lekhak had called for the committee's formation. Now, as the home minister, he is responsible for executing the report through the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Once Parliament approves the report, it becomes enforceable by law, and the Ministry of Home Affairs must ensure its implementation. Ramesh Lekhak, known for his legal acumen, holds the trust of NC members. The NC, while in government, had set a precedent by investigating former home ministers and a deputy prime minister in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam.
NC leader Balkrishna Khand was arrested during the tenure of NC Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka as deputy prime minister. NC members are now pressing to uphold this precedent. Among those recommended for action by the committee, led by MP Surya Thapa, is former Chairman of Gorkha Media Network GB Rai, who is currently absconding. Meanwhile, Managing Director Rabi Lamichhane claims to have received a 'clean chit.'
Although the report explicitly calls for action against him, Lamichhane, who chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), has been creating public confusion with his 'clean chit' claim. If enough evidence is provided, Lamichhane could face charges of forgery, fraud, and misuse of cooperative funds, as per the committee's recommendations. On Tuesday, he reiterated that there is no evidence against him. RSP members and MPs are also downplaying the committee's findings, asserting that Lamichhane has been exonerated.
Despite Lamichhane’s advocacy for good governance and anti-corruption, the committee's recommendation for action against him has placed him in a moral quandary. His insistence on receiving a 'clean chit' while confusing the public is seen as ethically questionable. GB Rai, also recommended for action, remains a fugitive, with an Interpol 'Diffusion Notice' issued against him.
The committee has proposed seizing the personal assets of cooperative operators and other involved parties to compensate the victims. Political leaders have stressed that the home minister has no option but to act on the report.
CPN-UML Central Committee Member Bishnu Rijal emphasized the need for swift implementation of the committee’s recommendations. ""The recommendations must be executed as stated. There should be no deviation, particularly regarding Rabi Lamichhane,"" he stated.
The report suggests that if institutional assets fall short, personal assets should be used to make up for the loss. ""The movable and immovable assets of the operators, involved individuals, their family members, and others should be freezed. If necessary, immovable assets should be converted into movable assets to return the depositors' funds,"" the committee recommended.
Due to the complete loss of funds invested in Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane was the managing director, legal provisions require the recovery of debts from the network's operators.
As the committee has directed the government to prepare an inventory of assets linked to illegal cooperative activities, Lamichhane cannot distance himself from the matter. The committee's financial analysis of 40 cooperatives revealed that Rs 87 billion are at risk. NC central member Ajay Babu Siwakoti has also called for the implementation of the report.
""Ramesh Lekhak was very vocal in advocating for the committee's formation. We trust that he will present the report to the Cabinet and ensure its implementation. Any delays or attempts to obstruct the process will not be forgiven, not just by NC members, but by the public. I am confident the home minister will take immediate action,"" Siwakoti said, urging the government to take the issue seriously.
On March 19, 2024, while serving as the NC’s chief whip, Lekhak called for the formation of a parliamentary committee for investigation. He warned that if the NC's demand was ignored, the party would continue to disrupt parliamentary proceedings. Consequently, the government formed the committee under MP Surya Thapa to investigate the cooperative fraud.
With the same committee now having submitted its report, Lekhak is in a position to act. Advocate Radhika Khatiwada emphasized that Lekhak should take responsibility. ""The Home Ministry must act against all those implicated in cooperative fraud, not just in Lamichhane's case,"" she said, stressing that the report should be seen as a legal obligation.
The committee has recommended establishing a Cooperative Authority within three months. Until then, the government should use the audit report for the fiscal year ending mi-July 2024 as a basis for regulating and supervising cooperatives with assets over NPR 500 million or those engaged in financial transactions, in line with amendments to the Cooperative Act, 2074 BS, and the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2058 BS. The Nepal Rastra Bank must ensure regulation and supervision under the latter act. The CPN (Maoist Center) has long advocated for the formation of the authority, and the committee appears to have addressed this demand.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 18: Ruling Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa has said that preparations are underway to pass the Education Act at the beginning of the upcoming parliamentary session.
Speaking at a National Education Day event held in Mulpani, Kathmandu, on Wednesday, Thapa mentioned that the government's common minimum program has also proposed moving forward to pass the Education Act swiftly.
He added that preparations are being made to pass the Education Act at the start of the winter session of parliament, which will begin right after Dashain and Tihar. He also shared that the government's common minimum program is set to be made public this evening.
""This evening, we will present the common minimum program of the newly formed government. We have also mentioned our preparation to pass the Education Bill soon in the program. But merely writing it is not enough. While we can draft it, the real work is inside parliament. It doesn't happen just because the government wants it,” he said, “Parliament must work together. Looking at the situation in parliament, it seemed like it might not pass for another two to two and a half years. Therefore, when I shared my views in the parliamentary committee, I made a special request to the chairperson, which I have also shared with my team.""
Thapa stated that political parties involved in the committee, including NC, CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Center), and Rastriya Prajatantra Party, should form groups along party lines and move forward with a consensus to pass the act. He suggested that if the committee was given two months to resolve any issues and reach an agreement, the Education Act could be passed soon.
He pledged to finalize the Education Act within a short period.

After the Budget Session concluded on September 16, the parliamentary committees, often referred to as the mini parliaments, are expected to become more active.
On Wednesday, only the meeting of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee and the National Assembly’s Committee on Federalism Enablement and National Concerns was scheduled. There are 14 committees in both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with two joint committees comprising members of both houses.
Primarily, the thematic committees, designated by ministries, are now expected to hold the government accountable on contemporary issues. These committees are tasked with monitoring the implementation of laws passed by parliament, overseeing black-market activities and the sale of adulterated food, inquiring about the work of the prime minister and ministers, and increasing surveillance on the government’s activities.
In addition, the committees must continue the process of drafting laws. However, past experiences show that committees often face a lack of quorum, which hinders discussions when parliament is not in session.
“If the committees fail to focus on the government’s activities when parliament is not in session, irregularities in the government cannot be investigated, and bad practices may increase,” said an official from the Parliament’s Secretariat.
“There are significant national festivals like Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath, during which members of parliament are likely to return to their districts and may only come back to the capital after Chhath. Considering this, the Speaker and Chairperson must direct the committees to ensure that their work continues,” he added.
According to him, parliamentary committees must function effectively by September, and after Dashain, their work is expected to resume from mid-October, following Tihar and Chhath. Members of parliament are expected to balance their duties between parliament and their constituencies. However, if they only focus on their constituencies at the expense of parliamentary work, the effectiveness of parliament will be compromised.
As the winter session of parliament will only convene after December, if the parliamentary committees do not monitor, discuss, and oversee government activities during this time period, staff at the Parliament Secretariat will have nothing to do but routine administrative work, he noted.
Parliamentary committees are the only bodies that can summon detailed documents of government activities. These documents are often made public through the media, which makes parliamentary committees an important institution in the democratic process.

 @RepublicaNepal BIRATNAGAR, May 13: Koshi Chief Minister (CM) Hikmat Kumar Karki is going to seek a vote of confidence today.
Karki, who was appointed as the Chief Minister on May 9, held a Cabinet meeting on the same day and decided to recommend to the Province Chief for convening the annual session of the Provincial Assembly.
On the recommendation of the government, the province chief Parshuram Khapung has called a session of the provincial assembly to be held at 11AM today.
CM Karki has prepared to seek the vote of confidence from today's meeting. For which he has already submitted a notice in the Provincial Assembly Secretariat.
NC is preparing to boycott the meeting where Chief Minister Karki will take the vote of confidence. While the writ petition against the Chief Minister's appointment process is pending in the Supreme Court, the Nepali Congress has said that it will boycott Chief Minister Karki citing haste in CM Karki’s move to seek the vote of confidence.
Outgoing Chief Minister Kedar Karki said that a meeting of Nepali Congress office-bearers and former office-bearers in Kathmandu instructed them to boycott the trust vote process.
According to Article 168 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister Kedar Karki, who was appointed on October 17, 2023, did not receive a vote of confidence after the partner party withdrew his support. Provincial Chief Khapung concluded that he was relieved of his post and called for the formation of a new government on May 8.
On May 9, Hikmat Karki was appointed Chief Minister on the same day after submitting the support of 52 provincial lawmakers from UML and Maoists. On the same day, Chief Minister Karki included one leader each of UML and Maoist in the cabinet.
After taking the vote of confidence, he plans to expand the cabinet.

The report concluded that 40 cooperatives have embezzled a total of Rs 87 billion of their depositors’ money.
The committee formed on May 28 also identified the involvement of four office bearers of Gorkha Media Network in the misappropriation of Rs 650 million received from a cooperative. Those implicated by the parliamentary committee include the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and former Managing Director of Gorkha Media Rabi Lamichhane, along with Chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; the company’s director Chhabilal Joshi; and partner Kumar Ramtel.
The committee recommended government action against the individuals. 
After receiving the report from Chairman Thapa, Speaker Devraj Ghimire directed the parliament secretariat to submit the report to the government for implementation.
With Speaker Ghimire’s instructions to the government to implement the recommendations made by the committee, it is yet to unfold how the government will take action.
Spokesperson for the HoR, Ekram Giri, informed Republica that preparation to send the letter to the government for implementation is underway. “If it wasn’t for a public holiday today, the house would have sent the letter right away,” he said, “Under the circumstances, the house will now send the letter on Wednesday.”
Upon receiving the letter from the house, the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers will present it to the Cabinet for discussion and finalization. The Cabinet will then decide on directing the relevant line ministry, Giri added.
According to Senior Advocate Tikaram Bhattarai, after discussion in the Cabinet, it will direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to proceed with further actions. “The Home Ministry will then instruct the police administration to conduct the investigation. The police may handle the investigation themselves or assign it to the CIB. The investigation by the police or CIB will determine what charges are necessary,” Bhattarai said, “After this, the matter will be discussed with the Attorney General’s office, and then the case will proceed to court. Only after following all the due processes can the matter proceed to court,” Bhattarai added.
He mentioned that based on the nature of the incident, it appears that those recommended for disciplinary action will likely face charges related to cooperative fraud. These matters are explained under the Cooperative Act, 2074, he said.
The report mentions that Gorkha Media, where Lamichhane was the MD, had obtained funds from Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Chitwan Multipurpose Cooperative, Swarnalaxmi Multipurpose Cooperative, and Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative.
According to the report, Lamichhane has committed at least eight serious offenses including unlawfully deploying cooperative funds into the company, failing to inquire about or record the legal source of such a large amount of money, providing false information in audit reports, claiming non-existent sweat equity without any legal documentation. 
Similarly, the offenses include engaging in share transactions with fake transactions at the company registrar's office, leading the company into mismanagement, evading taxes through fraudulent transactions, and attempting to evade responsibility by claiming ignorance.
The parliamentary committee reached this conclusion after conducting an investigation for three and a half months. Initially, the House had set a timeframe of three months, but on September 3, Chairman Thapa requested an additional 15-day extension, which the House approved.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 17: Dr CK Raut, chairman of the Janamat Party, has lodged complaints at the District Court, Kathmandu, the Cyber ​​Bureau of Nepal Police and Press Council Nepal alleging that false news has been broadcast against him.
Dr Raut has filed complaints with three agencies of the state for publishing” misleading news” about his family and his wife Soni Sindhu Rani. A complaint has been filed at the District Court Kathmandu against the chairperson and editor of the online news of  Sheersha Khabar Pvt Ltd, Kalpana Dahal, as well as Dinesh Sharma of Fattepur, Saptari, Shyam Kumar Yadav and journalist Baidyanath Yadav.
Sharad Singh, spokesperson for Janamat Party, said that Dr Raut has filed the complaint because of the publication of untrue and misleading news about his family's private affairs.
Raut has stated in his complaint letter that the issues raised by the opposition and published in the media are personal matters filed in court. He has claimed that the news reports about him having an affair with another woman and being caught red-handed multiple times are false, fabricated, and damaging to his reputation.
Raut has also mentioned in the complaint letter that his wife, Soni Sindhu Rani, is not in a stable mental state. He said that she had previously sought a divorce but she has not accepted it now.
Raut filed for divorce from his wife, Sindhu Rani, under the title 'Partition and Divorce' in August, as reported by the court's spokesperson, Ram Sajiwan Mahato.
