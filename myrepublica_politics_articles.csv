 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The Communist Party of Nepal (UML) has introduced a rule prohibiting the formation of panels in election during the party convention. According to the party’s newly released 'Annual Action Plan for Decisive National Strength Building,' candidates running for any committee position must present themselves individually to voters without forming or promoting any panels.
The action plan, unveiled by General Secretary Shankar Pokharel, outlines a goal of reaching 1 million members by the party's upcoming 11th Convention. Membership expansion will focus on mass organizations and contact platforms.
Additionally, the party plans to implement an online system for membership documentation and mandates basic training for all new and current party members. Party membership cards will be issued by district committees based on demand.
Committees that fail to hold sessions within the period stipulated by the party statute will automatically be converted into organizational committees. Moreover, those with financial arrears to the party will be barred from running for positions in conventions and elected bodies.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The Parliamentary Hearings Committee (PHC) has approved the names of 16 out of 17 proposed ambassadors for various countries, as submitted by the government.
In a meeting held at Singha Durbar on Thursday, the committee endorsed the names of 16 ambassadors by a majority vote, out of the 17 proposed candidates.
Committee Chairperson Ishwari Devi Neupane announced that the decision was made after considering complaints from petitioners, the clarifications of the proposed ambassadors, their work plans, and their statements.
The committee approved 16 ambassadors by majority vote. However, some documents related to the proposed ambassador for Sri Lanka, Ram Krishna Bhattarai, were found to be incomplete. Therefore, the committee has directed the secretariat to request additional documents.
Neupane mentioned that Rastriya Swatantra Party lawmaker Dol Prasad Aryal expressed differing opinions on the proposed ambassadors for Israel, Prof Dhan Prasad Pandit; South Africa, Prof Dr Kapil Shrestha; and Malaysia, Dr Netra Prasad Timalsina.
Likewise, Janata Samajwadi Party Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari had differing views regarding the proposed ambassador to India, Shankar Sharma.
In the case of Pandit, a legal matter is pending in the Supreme Court. Aryal argued that Shrestha cannot be appointed ambassador due to a constitutional provision prohibiting individuals who have served as members of the National Human Rights Commission from holding other government positions. In the case of Timalsina, he has filed a case in the Supreme Court against the government.
Shrestha was a member of the National Human Rights Commission from 2057 BS to 2062 BS, while Pandit has been convicted by the Patan High Court. Regarding Sharma, concerns were raised about the guidelines for ambassadorial appointments, which prohibit consecutive terms. Sharma was appointed ambassador to India in Chaitra 2078 but was recalled before completing his tenure by the previous government.
Of the four proposed ambassadors who have courted controversy, Sharma, Shrestha, and Pandit represent the Nepali Congress, while Timalsina is from the UML quota. Chitralekha Yadav has been recommended ambassador under the Madhesi woman quota and Sewa Lamsal from the Foreign Service.
The cabinet meeting on Shrawan 14 (July 29) recommended new ambassadors for various countries. Dr Shankar Prasad Sharma was nominated for India, Kanta Rijal for Australia, and Naresh Bikram Dhakal for Saudi Arabia. Other recommendations included Prof Dr Kapil Man Shrestha for South Africa, Prof  Dhan Prasad Pandit for Israel, and Ram Krishna Bhattarai for Sri Lanka. Shanil Nepal was proposed for Spain, Dr Shail Rupakheti for Germany, and Lok Darshan Regmi for the USA. Chandra Kumar Ghimire was nominated for the UK, while Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe was selected for South Korea. Janga Bahadur Chauhan was recommended for Russia, Ramesh Chandra Paudel for Qatar, and Prof Dr Krishna Prasad Oli for China. Sumnina Tuladhar was recommended ambassador for Denmark, Dr Netra Prasad Timilsina for Malaysia, and Prakash Mani Paudel for Portugal. Likewise, Rita Dhital was recommended for Pakistan.
There is a constitutional provision for the president to appoint the ambassadors after approval by the parliamentary committee.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: The family dispute of Chandrakant (CK) Raut, the chairman of the Janamat Party, has reached its peak. Despite Raut filing for divorce from his wife Soni Sindhu Rani, the conflict between the couple remains unresolved.
Both individuals have approached the police, claiming to feel unsafe due to each other. According to the Lalitpur police, Raut visited the Imadol Police Sector a few days ago, requesting peace and security due to feeling unsafe from his wife, Rani.
On Thursday, Raut's wife Rani also went to the Satdobato Police Circle, requesting protection and claiming to feel unsafe due to her husband. However, the police have not yet registered her complaint. “She (Rani) went to the Satdobato Police Circle claiming insecurity from her husband,” said a Lalitpur police source. “The complaint has not yet been registered, but she is in contact with DSP Chitra Bhattarai at the station.”
Police said that the case is currently under consideration. 
Raut filed for divorce from his wife Rani at the Lalitpur District Court on August 28 under the title “Partition and Divorce.”
Raut, who resides in Mahalakshmi Municipality-4 in Lalitpur, filed for divorce due to marital discord. The complaint alleges that his wife frequently visited her parental home and that their relationship had become strained, among other issues, according to Spokesperson Ram Sajiwan Mahato of the court.
“Raut has stated in the divorce petition that his wife repeatedly asked for a divorce and even attempted suicide to pressure him into it,” Mahato said.
The couple has two daughters and one son, and Raut has requested custody of the children. 
Raut's wife Rani is from Simriya Ghat in Bihar, India.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 19: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Arzu Rana Deuba, has urged the Canadian government to establish an embassy in Nepal. She made this request during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly on Wednesday in Ottawa, Canada.
“The number of Nepali students going to Canada for studies has been increasing day by day, and the number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal is also on the rise,” she said. “Similarly, researchers, businesspersons, and other citizens from various sectors of both countries are increasingly exchanging visits. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, and I would like to make this request.”
Minister Rana also emphasized the need for Canada to consider establishing its embassy in a democratic country like Nepal, situated between two large Asian nations, during her discussion with Foreign Minister Joly.
The meeting covered various aspects of Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, and concerns, as well as topics such as economic investment and partnership.
During the conversation, both ministers highlighted the cordial relations between the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1965. Nepal and Canada will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship next year.
Minister Rana also appreciated Canada's support in Nepal's democratic process and the drafting of the current Constitution.
She informed that Nepal's parliament recently passed the transitional justice law, which will help complete the remaining tasks of the peace process.
On that occasion, Minister Rana recalled Canada's long-standing economic aid and development support to Nepal in various sectors under different titles.

Canada KATHMANDU, Sept 19: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Arzu Rana Deuba, has urged the Canadian government to establish an embassy in Nepal. She made this request during a bilateral meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly on Wednesday in Ottawa, Canada. “The number of Nepali students going to Canada for studies has been increasing day by day, and the number of Canadian tourists visiting Nepal is also on the rise,” she said. “Similarly, researchers, businesspersons, and other citizens from various sectors of both countries are increasingly exchanging visits. Therefore, it would be appropriate for Canada to establish an embassy in Nepal, and I would like to make this request.” Minister Rana also emphasized the need for Canada to consider establishing its embassy in a democratic country like Nepal, situated between two large Asian nations, during her discussion with Foreign Minister Joly. The meeting covered various aspects of Nepal-Canada relations, mutual interests, and concerns, as well as topics such as economic investment and partnership. During the conversation, both ministers highlighted the cordial relations between the two countries since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1965. Nepal and Canada will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of their diplomatic relationship next year. Minister Rana also appreciated Canada's support in Nepal's democratic process and the drafting of the current Constitution. She informed that Nepal's parliament recently passed the transitional justice law, which will help complete the remaining tasks of the peace process. On that occasion, Minister Rana recalled Canada's long-standing economic aid and development support to Nepal in various sectors under different titles. Currently, Minister Rana is in Canada on a visit at the invitation of Canadian Minister Joly. She is scheduled to attend the Meeting of Women Foreign Ministers, which will be held on 19-20 September in Toronto. She had left for Canada on Monday evening.

                                                                                            By: Tapendra Karki KATHMANDU, Sept 18: The report of the parliamentary special committee investigating the misuse of cooperative funds is now set to test Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, who plays a crucial role in its implementation. Previously, as the chief whip of the Nepali Congress (NC) in opposition, Lekhak had called for the committee's formation. Now, as the home minister, he is responsible for executing the report through the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Once Parliament approves the report, it becomes enforceable by law, and the Ministry of Home Affairs must ensure its implementation. Ramesh Lekhak, known for his legal acumen, holds the trust of NC members. The NC, while in government, had set a precedent by investigating former home ministers and a deputy prime minister in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam.
NC leader Balkrishna Khand was arrested during the tenure of NC Vice President Purna Bahadur Khadka as deputy prime minister. NC members are now pressing to uphold this precedent. Among those recommended for action by the committee, led by MP Surya Thapa, is former Chairman of Gorkha Media Network GB Rai, who is currently absconding. Meanwhile, Managing Director Rabi Lamichhane claims to have received a 'clean chit.'
Although the report explicitly calls for action against him, Lamichhane, who chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), has been creating public confusion with his 'clean chit' claim. If enough evidence is provided, Lamichhane could face charges of forgery, fraud, and misuse of cooperative funds, as per the committee's recommendations. On Tuesday, he reiterated that there is no evidence against him. RSP members and MPs are also downplaying the committee's findings, asserting that Lamichhane has been exonerated.
Despite Lamichhane’s advocacy for good governance and anti-corruption, the committee's recommendation for action against him has placed him in a moral quandary. His insistence on receiving a 'clean chit' while confusing the public is seen as ethically questionable. GB Rai, also recommended for action, remains a fugitive, with an Interpol 'Diffusion Notice' issued against him.
The committee has proposed seizing the personal assets of cooperative operators and other involved parties to compensate the victims. Political leaders have stressed that the home minister has no option but to act on the report.
CPN-UML Central Committee Member Bishnu Rijal emphasized the need for swift implementation of the committee’s recommendations. ""The recommendations must be executed as stated. There should be no deviation, particularly regarding Rabi Lamichhane,"" he stated.
The report suggests that if institutional assets fall short, personal assets should be used to make up for the loss. ""The movable and immovable assets of the operators, involved individuals, their family members, and others should be freezed. If necessary, immovable assets should be converted into movable assets to return the depositors' funds,"" the committee recommended.
Due to the complete loss of funds invested in Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane was the managing director, legal provisions require the recovery of debts from the network's operators.
As the committee has directed the government to prepare an inventory of assets linked to illegal cooperative activities, Lamichhane cannot distance himself from the matter. The committee's financial analysis of 40 cooperatives revealed that Rs 87 billion are at risk. NC central member Ajay Babu Siwakoti has also called for the implementation of the report.
""Ramesh Lekhak was very vocal in advocating for the committee's formation. We trust that he will present the report to the Cabinet and ensure its implementation. Any delays or attempts to obstruct the process will not be forgiven, not just by NC members, but by the public. I am confident the home minister will take immediate action,"" Siwakoti said, urging the government to take the issue seriously.
On March 19, 2024, while serving as the NC’s chief whip, Lekhak called for the formation of a parliamentary committee for investigation. He warned that if the NC's demand was ignored, the party would continue to disrupt parliamentary proceedings. Consequently, the government formed the committee under MP Surya Thapa to investigate the cooperative fraud.
With the same committee now having submitted its report, Lekhak is in a position to act. Advocate Radhika Khatiwada emphasized that Lekhak should take responsibility. ""The Home Ministry must act against all those implicated in cooperative fraud, not just in Lamichhane's case,"" she said, stressing that the report should be seen as a legal obligation.
The committee has recommended establishing a Cooperative Authority within three months. Until then, the government should use the audit report for the fiscal year ending mi-July 2024 as a basis for regulating and supervising cooperatives with assets over NPR 500 million or those engaged in financial transactions, in line with amendments to the Cooperative Act, 2074 BS, and the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2058 BS. The Nepal Rastra Bank must ensure regulation and supervision under the latter act. The CPN (Maoist Center) has long advocated for the formation of the authority, and the committee appears to have addressed this demand.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 18: Ruling Nepali Congress (NC) General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa has said that preparations are underway to pass the Education Act at the beginning of the upcoming parliamentary session.
Speaking at a National Education Day event held in Mulpani, Kathmandu, on Wednesday, Thapa mentioned that the government's common minimum program has also proposed moving forward to pass the Education Act swiftly.
He added that preparations are being made to pass the Education Act at the start of the winter session of parliament, which will begin right after Dashain and Tihar. He also shared that the government's common minimum program is set to be made public this evening.
""This evening, we will present the common minimum program of the newly formed government. We have also mentioned our preparation to pass the Education Bill soon in the program. But merely writing it is not enough. While we can draft it, the real work is inside parliament. It doesn't happen just because the government wants it,” he said, “Parliament must work together. Looking at the situation in parliament, it seemed like it might not pass for another two to two and a half years. Therefore, when I shared my views in the parliamentary committee, I made a special request to the chairperson, which I have also shared with my team.""
Thapa stated that political parties involved in the committee, including NC, CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Center), and Rastriya Prajatantra Party, should form groups along party lines and move forward with a consensus to pass the act. He suggested that if the committee was given two months to resolve any issues and reach an agreement, the Education Act could be passed soon.
He pledged to finalize the Education Act within a short period.

After the Budget Session concluded on September 16, the parliamentary committees, often referred to as the mini parliaments, are expected to become more active.
On Wednesday, only the meeting of the House of Representatives’ Finance Committee and the National Assembly’s Committee on Federalism Enablement and National Concerns was scheduled. There are 14 committees in both the House of Representatives and the National Assembly, with two joint committees comprising members of both houses.
Primarily, the thematic committees, designated by ministries, are now expected to hold the government accountable on contemporary issues. These committees are tasked with monitoring the implementation of laws passed by parliament, overseeing black-market activities and the sale of adulterated food, inquiring about the work of the prime minister and ministers, and increasing surveillance on the government’s activities.
In addition, the committees must continue the process of drafting laws. However, past experiences show that committees often face a lack of quorum, which hinders discussions when parliament is not in session.
“If the committees fail to focus on the government’s activities when parliament is not in session, irregularities in the government cannot be investigated, and bad practices may increase,” said an official from the Parliament’s Secretariat.
“There are significant national festivals like Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath, during which members of parliament are likely to return to their districts and may only come back to the capital after Chhath. Considering this, the Speaker and Chairperson must direct the committees to ensure that their work continues,” he added.
According to him, parliamentary committees must function effectively by September, and after Dashain, their work is expected to resume from mid-October, following Tihar and Chhath. Members of parliament are expected to balance their duties between parliament and their constituencies. However, if they only focus on their constituencies at the expense of parliamentary work, the effectiveness of parliament will be compromised.
As the winter session of parliament will only convene after December, if the parliamentary committees do not monitor, discuss, and oversee government activities during this time period, staff at the Parliament Secretariat will have nothing to do but routine administrative work, he noted.
Parliamentary committees are the only bodies that can summon detailed documents of government activities. These documents are often made public through the media, which makes parliamentary committees an important institution in the democratic process.

 @RepublicaNepal BIRATNAGAR, May 13: Koshi Chief Minister (CM) Hikmat Kumar Karki is going to seek a vote of confidence today.
Karki, who was appointed as the Chief Minister on May 9, held a Cabinet meeting on the same day and decided to recommend to the Province Chief for convening the annual session of the Provincial Assembly.
On the recommendation of the government, the province chief Parshuram Khapung has called a session of the provincial assembly to be held at 11AM today.
CM Karki has prepared to seek the vote of confidence from today's meeting. For which he has already submitted a notice in the Provincial Assembly Secretariat.
NC is preparing to boycott the meeting where Chief Minister Karki will take the vote of confidence. While the writ petition against the Chief Minister's appointment process is pending in the Supreme Court, the Nepali Congress has said that it will boycott Chief Minister Karki citing haste in CM Karki’s move to seek the vote of confidence.
Outgoing Chief Minister Kedar Karki said that a meeting of Nepali Congress office-bearers and former office-bearers in Kathmandu instructed them to boycott the trust vote process.
According to Article 168 of the Constitution, the Chief Minister Kedar Karki, who was appointed on October 17, 2023, did not receive a vote of confidence after the partner party withdrew his support. Provincial Chief Khapung concluded that he was relieved of his post and called for the formation of a new government on May 8.
On May 9, Hikmat Karki was appointed Chief Minister on the same day after submitting the support of 52 provincial lawmakers from UML and Maoists. On the same day, Chief Minister Karki included one leader each of UML and Maoist in the cabinet.
After taking the vote of confidence, he plans to expand the cabinet.

The report concluded that 40 cooperatives have embezzled a total of Rs 87 billion of their depositors’ money.
The committee formed on May 28 also identified the involvement of four office bearers of Gorkha Media Network in the misappropriation of Rs 650 million received from a cooperative. Those implicated by the parliamentary committee include the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and former Managing Director of Gorkha Media Rabi Lamichhane, along with Chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; the company’s director Chhabilal Joshi; and partner Kumar Ramtel.
The committee recommended government action against the individuals. 
After receiving the report from Chairman Thapa, Speaker Devraj Ghimire directed the parliament secretariat to submit the report to the government for implementation.
With Speaker Ghimire’s instructions to the government to implement the recommendations made by the committee, it is yet to unfold how the government will take action.
Spokesperson for the HoR, Ekram Giri, informed Republica that preparation to send the letter to the government for implementation is underway. “If it wasn’t for a public holiday today, the house would have sent the letter right away,” he said, “Under the circumstances, the house will now send the letter on Wednesday.”
Upon receiving the letter from the house, the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers will present it to the Cabinet for discussion and finalization. The Cabinet will then decide on directing the relevant line ministry, Giri added.
According to Senior Advocate Tikaram Bhattarai, after discussion in the Cabinet, it will direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to proceed with further actions. “The Home Ministry will then instruct the police administration to conduct the investigation. The police may handle the investigation themselves or assign it to the CIB. The investigation by the police or CIB will determine what charges are necessary,” Bhattarai said, “After this, the matter will be discussed with the Attorney General’s office, and then the case will proceed to court. Only after following all the due processes can the matter proceed to court,” Bhattarai added.
He mentioned that based on the nature of the incident, it appears that those recommended for disciplinary action will likely face charges related to cooperative fraud. These matters are explained under the Cooperative Act, 2074, he said.
The report mentions that Gorkha Media, where Lamichhane was the MD, had obtained funds from Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Chitwan Multipurpose Cooperative, Swarnalaxmi Multipurpose Cooperative, and Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative.
According to the report, Lamichhane has committed at least eight serious offenses including unlawfully deploying cooperative funds into the company, failing to inquire about or record the legal source of such a large amount of money, providing false information in audit reports, claiming non-existent sweat equity without any legal documentation. 
Similarly, the offenses include engaging in share transactions with fake transactions at the company registrar's office, leading the company into mismanagement, evading taxes through fraudulent transactions, and attempting to evade responsibility by claiming ignorance.
The parliamentary committee reached this conclusion after conducting an investigation for three and a half months. Initially, the House had set a timeframe of three months, but on September 3, Chairman Thapa requested an additional 15-day extension, which the House approved.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 17: Dr CK Raut, chairman of the Janamat Party, has lodged complaints at the District Court, Kathmandu, the Cyber ​​Bureau of Nepal Police and Press Council Nepal alleging that false news has been broadcast against him.
Dr Raut has filed complaints with three agencies of the state for publishing” misleading news” about his family and his wife Soni Sindhu Rani. A complaint has been filed at the District Court Kathmandu against the chairperson and editor of the online news of  Sheersha Khabar Pvt Ltd, Kalpana Dahal, as well as Dinesh Sharma of Fattepur, Saptari, Shyam Kumar Yadav and journalist Baidyanath Yadav.
Sharad Singh, spokesperson for Janamat Party, said that Dr Raut has filed the complaint because of the publication of untrue and misleading news about his family's private affairs.
Raut has stated in his complaint letter that the issues raised by the opposition and published in the media are personal matters filed in court. He has claimed that the news reports about him having an affair with another woman and being caught red-handed multiple times are false, fabricated, and damaging to his reputation.
Raut has also mentioned in the complaint letter that his wife, Soni Sindhu Rani, is not in a stable mental state. He said that she had previously sought a divorce but she has not accepted it now.
Raut filed for divorce from his wife, Sindhu Rani, under the title 'Partition and Divorce' in August, as reported by the court's spokesperson, Ram Sajiwan Mahato.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 17: Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balram Adhikari, has expressed the government’s commitment to form the much-demanded Land Commission within a month to foster and facilitate agriculture-related entrepreneurial mindset across the nation.
Addressing the 11th General Assembly of the Asian Farmers' Association (AFA) in Kathmandu, Minister Adhikari said that the ministry has prepared to amend the law for the formation of the commission within a month. “When the individuals involved in agriculture and land become entrepreneurial, we will observe a positive change in the lives of farmers and the entire nation,” he said, “To facilitate such entrepreneurial mindset, we will form a Land Commission within a month.”
Minister Ahikari added that Nepal will not progress unless the farmers are well-equipped for their agricultural activities. ""We are attempting to formulate a good policy and implement it on time,” he said. He asserted that the problems of the farmers will only be addressed when farmers take the initiative to become leaders. 
Highlighting the need for working on climate resilience, Minister Adhikari also discussed the notable negative impact of climate change and global warming on the agricultural sector. “Discussions between experts in agriculture and land in different countries can help us find general solutions to the existent negative effect of climate change in our agriculture and land sectors,” he said, “However, the environment, climate, geography, and land of Nepal needs to be considered while formulating policies to mitigate the effects of climate change in Nepal.”
Stating that achieving the constitutionally guaranteed right to adequate food is becoming a challenge due to the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector, Minister Adhikari claimed that addressing the needs of the farmers is another key step to ensuring food security in Nepal. “Food security is a looming problem for our country,” he said, “Unless the needs of the farmers are addressed, the problem of food security will eventually affect our country’s entire economy.” He added that the bureaucrats in the ministry are working diligently to secure the general public’s constitutionally guaranteed right to adequate food.
The two-day general assembly of the AFA being held in the capital is being attended by over 150 representatives from 22 farmer-related organizations of 19 countries. A five-day Regional Farmers Workshop will follow the general assembly. Minister Adhikari lauded the nature of the program, emphasizing the need for farmers from Asian countries to come together for solving agriculture-related problems.

Land_Commission KATHMANDU, Sept 17: Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation, Balram Adhikari, has expressed the government’s commitment to form the much-demanded Land Commission within a month to foster and facilitate agriculture-related entrepreneurial mindset across the nation. Addressing the 11th General Assembly of the Asian Farmers' Association (AFA) in Kathmandu, Minister Adhikari said that the ministry has prepared to amend the law for the formation of the commission within a month. “When the individuals involved in agriculture and land become entrepreneurial, we will observe a positive change in the lives of farmers and the entire nation,” he said, “To facilitate such entrepreneurial mindset, we will form a Land Commission within a month.” Minister Ahikari added that Nepal will not progress unless the farmers are well-equipped for their agricultural activities. ""We are attempting to formulate a good policy and implement it on time,” he said. He asserted that the problems of the farmers will only be addressed when farmers take the initiative to become leaders. Highlighting the need for working on climate resilience, Minister Adhikari also discussed the notable negative impact of climate change and global warming on the agricultural sector. “Discussions between experts in agriculture and land in different countries can help us find general solutions to the existent negative effect of climate change in our agriculture and land sectors,” he said, “However, the environment, climate, geography, and land of Nepal needs to be considered while formulating policies to mitigate the effects of climate change in Nepal.” Stating that achieving the constitutionally guaranteed right to adequate food is becoming a challenge due to the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector, Minister Adhikari claimed that addressing the needs of the farmers is another key step to ensuring food security in Nepal. “Food security is a looming problem for our country,” he said, “Unless the needs of the farmers are addressed, the problem of food security will eventually affect our country’s entire economy.” He added that the bureaucrats in the ministry are working diligently to secure the general public’s constitutionally guaranteed right to adequate food. The two-day general assembly of the AFA being held in the capital is being attended by over 150 representatives from 22 farmer-related organizations of 19 countries. A five-day Regional Farmers Workshop will follow the general assembly. Minister Adhikari lauded the nature of the program, emphasizing the need for farmers from Asian countries to come together for solving agriculture-related problems.

                                                                                            By: Kamal Bista KATHMANDU, Sept 17: The ruling alliance appears to have stepped back from its plan to remove Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives (HoR) Indira Rana over a letter she wrote to the US Embassy, requesting a visa interview for individuals unrelated to her office.
The ruling party CPN-UML, which had initially proposed removing Rana, citing her failure to maintain the decorum of her office, seems to have softened its stance. Mahesh Bartaula, Chief whip of UML’s parliamentary caucus, informed Republica that the removal effort is not currently on the agenda and accused the opposition of fabricating the issue.
At a meeting of the ruling alliance held at Baluwatar on September 9, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had proposed Rana's removal, which garnered the support of the coalition partners at the time. The following day’s meeting of the House of Representatives (HoR) saw a heated debate on Rana's removal. UML lawmakers called for her resignation on moral grounds, urging her to step down to pave way for a new deputy speaker while lawmakers from the major opposition parties Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and CPN (Maoist Centre), not only opposed the move but also threatened to hit the street with protests if the ruling alliance proceeded with her ouster.
Chief whip Bartaula clarified that the questions raised by UML leaders were not intended to oust Rana but rather to raise the issue at parliament. “Questions were raised in parliament about the Deputy Speaker's conduct being incompatible with her office,” he informed Republica, “The House will decide accordingly.”
In a recent statement, Deputy Speaker Rana claimed that PM Oli has assured her that the issue has been settled. Speaking to a group of journalists after the meeting of the Constitutional Council (CC) on Friday, Deputy Speaker Rana said she had discussed the matter of her potential removal with the PM. “I brought up the issue, and the PM said, ‘You are a member of the CC. Let's not discuss market rumors. Let them stay in the market,’” she said. 
Rana also clarified that the letter in question had never reached the embassy, nor had the individuals traveled to the US. “In fact, the letter hasn't even been registered,” she added.
Another key party in the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress (NC), also appears to have withdrawn from the issue for now. On Wednesday, the NC had issued a whip instructing lawmakers not to leave the Kathmandu Valley, while those outside were directed to return to the capital as preparation for a possible motion to remove Rana. NC Chief whip Shyam Ghimire clarified that directing lawmakers is a common practice within the party. “With the parliament on the verge of adjournment, issuing directives to lawmakers is a normal procedure within the party,” he told Republica.
Reports suggest that the proposal to remove Rana, initially made by PM Oli, was influenced by the NC, as the six-member CC does not include a member from the NC. The lack of a clear majority in the CC hampers the ruling coalition’s ability to make constitutional appointments. 
In the CC, PM Oli and Speaker of the HoR Devraj Ghimire hail from the UML, while National Assembly Chair Narayan Dahal and opposition leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal represent the Maoist Centre. Deputy Speaker Rana is an MP from the RSP, which is also in the opposition. The NC lacks representation in the council.
It is also reported that the ruling alliance stepped back from removing Rana as some fringe parties indicated they would not support the removal proposal. According to the constitution, a removal proposal requires two-thirds majority (184 votes) of the 275-member parliament. Without the support of fringe parties like the Janamat Party, Loktantrik Samajwadi Party (LSP) Nepal, and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Nepal, the ruling alliance cannot pass the proposal since the votes of NC and UML together total 167 (88 from NC and 79 from UML). 
The CK Raut led Janamat Party, an external supporter of the coalition with six seats in the House, did not respond positively to the removal proposal despite initially agreeing with Oli. Speaking to News Agency Nepal on Wednesday, Raut accused the government of trying to remove Rana with malicious intent. He claimed that the government’s goal was to secure a majority in the CC.
Another external supporter of the ruling coalition, JSP Nepal, which holds five seats, remained neutral on the issue, stating they would decide if a formal motion for removal is introduced. 
However, JSP Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari expressed his view that removing Rana would not foster a positive political culture. “The party has not made an official decision on this issue, but personally, I believe it is inappropriate,” he told Republica. He criticized the increasing trend of removing CC members to serve vested political interests. He also acknowledged that Rana made a mistake by misusing her power and failing to uphold the integrity of her position. 
Sarbendra Nath Shukla, a lawmaker of the LSP Nepal, argued that Rana did not commit a major crime by writing the letter for a visa interview. Shukla remarked that leaders from various parties are engaged in far worse activities than Rana. “This is nothing compared to the gold scandal, the Bhutanese refugee scandal, the 70-crore scandal, and the corruption in the COVID vaccine,” he told Republica, “She committed a wrong act, but it was not a blunder.”
Other fringe parties, including the JSP and the Nagarik Unmukti Party, which hold seven and four seats respectively, have not yet issued public statements on whether they support the motion to oust Rana.
Deputy Speaker Rana, who was nominated to parliament by the opposition RSP under the indigenous category, courted controversy after a letter dated February 26, 2023, was leaked in July. In the letter, she requested the US embassy to expedite the visa process for her entourage to the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. Her letter sparked discussions in parliament and the broader political landscape.

After the CPN (Maoist Center) withdrew its support, Karki is set to seek a vote of confidence for a second time. The Maoist Center formally withdrew its support on August 30, following its exit from the Koshi government on July 26.
Following the change in the ruling coalition, the government formed with the support of the Maoist Center has now been replaced by a new government led by the CPN-UML, with the participation of the Nepali Congress.
Chief Minister Karki is preparing to seek a vote of confidence for a second time under Article 168(5) of the Constitution. The Koshi Provincial Assembly has 93 members, with 40 from Karki's party, CPN-UML, and 29 from the Nepali Congress.
There are 13 members from the Maoist Center, six from Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), four from CPN (Unified Socialist), and one from Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) in the provincial assembly. Chief Minister Karki had previously sought a vote of confidence for the first time on May 31.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 16: The final report of the parliamentary committee investigating cooperative fraud has been completed, with all seven members signing it, preparing it for submission to parliament.
The report was finalized yesterday and was signed by all committee members earlier this morning.
Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) member Shishir Khanal had earlier questioned the grounds for recommending any action against Rabi Lamichhane in connection with the embezzlement case.
While committee members agreed that GB Rai's role was mainly limited to transferring the cooperative’s funds to Gorkha Media, they pointed out that as Managing Director, Rabi Lamichhane allocated the funds for various administrative uses, such as employee salaries.
Two members from the Nepali Congress argued for action against Lamichhane for using cooperative funds for media-related expenses, leading to some difficult discussions.
However, despite these differences, the committee members reached an agreement and collectively signed the final report.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 16: Prime Minister KP Oli is addressing the House of Representatives at 1PM today, after the Maoist Center agreed to allow the session to proceed.
PM Oli's Secretariat has confirmed his speech today, with the session set to conclude afterward. The Council of Ministers has already recommended ending the annual session, pending formal notification from the President.
Today’s agenda includes the Speaker reading a letter from the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers and the presentation of an investigation report by Surya Thapa, head of the Parliamentary Special Committee on Misuse of Cooperative Savings.

The committee meeting, which continued late into the night, concluded that Lamichhane embezzled cooperative funds. ""All the evidence presented to the committee did not show him as innocent,"" a source stated.
The committee has determined that Rabi Lamichhane, former Managing Director of Gorkha Media Network and a former home minister, and chairman of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), along with the company's Chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, and Director Chhabilal Joshi, operated a joint account, disbursed salaries and allowances to employees from the cooperative, and filled out KYC forms at the bank, confirming their signatures on checks. Therefore, the committee has concluded that Lamichhane is not found innocent.
""He does not appear to be cleared of charges. It seems that the money from the cooperative was used to open Gorkha Media and pay salaries and allowances. There are no policies or regulations for using cooperative funds for media purposes. It is also evident that a joint account was operated in two banks,"" said a member of the committee. ""Despite what is said externally, there is no evidence of investment from sources other than the cooperative. The member also mentioned that funds were withdrawn using Lamichhane's signature. “Money was withdrawn through checks signed by Lamichhane,” the source added.
During the 9-hour interrogation by the investigation committee, Lamichhane claimed that he was unaware of the investments, income, and expenses of Gorkha Media. Prior to leaving Gorkha Media, he had praised GB Rai, saying that one needs a heart like his. The audit report of the company's investments, loans, and assets also shows signatures of Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai as the chairman and Rabi Lamichhane as the managing director. Like Rai, Lamichhane had transferred the cooperative’s savings to the company, presenting it as his investment, and secured shares from the Company Registrar's Office on April 17, 2020.
Lamichhane also mentioned in the documents submitted to the Company Registrar's Office, which include signatures and thumbprints, that he had invested money in the company for 15 percent of the shares. The committee's report was prepared by 2:30 AM. The meeting to finalize the report, which started at 10 AM on Friday, continued until 2:30 AM. Additionally, the meeting decided to send a written request for further investigation into the matter of Nepali Congress Vice-President Dhanraj Gurung.
""Although not mentioned in the terms of reference, the committee has determined that there is a need for investigation since a complaint was received, and a large amount of money is involved, with the Gurung couple being implicated,"" said a member of the committee. Sources claim that parliamentary committee members Shishir Khanal from RSP and Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Center were trying to protect Lamichhane without naming him directly. 
""It seemed that Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Center was more inclined to protect him than Shishir Khanal from RSP,"" said a committee member. If the committee identifies the guilty parties and submits the report, Lamichhane will have to resign from his position and face investigation. The committee will present the report at today's parliamentary session.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 15: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has initiated discussions with relevant authorities to eliminate fees on small digital transactions. The move follows numerous public complaints, primarily shared through Facebook, regarding the costs linked to mobile banking and digital transfers.
In a Facebook post, PM Oli recognized that many Nepalis have become accustomed to cashless transactions for daily financial activities. He expressed concern over the additional fees charged for small transactions, stating, ""Most of us now transfer money digitally, and these extra charges are burdening the public.""
The Prime Minister encouraged the public to share their concerns with the government, promising action. ""Keep nudging us, and we will continue to address these issues,"" Oli wrote.
Citing an example, Oli referred to a complaint from Abin BK of Jajarkot, who said he spends Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200 monthly on transaction fees alone, with a charge of Rs 11.30 per transfer. Abin shared, ""I make daily transactions of Rs 50 to Rs 100, about 5-6 times a day, and the fees are eating into my budget.""
Currently, mobile banking fees for digital transfers range from Rs 4.52 to Rs 22.60 per transaction, with additional charges for interbank transfers and utility payments.

small_digital_transaction KATHMANDU, Sept 15: Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has initiated discussions with relevant authorities to eliminate fees on small digital transactions. The move follows numerous public complaints, primarily shared through Facebook, regarding the costs linked to mobile banking and digital transfers. In a Facebook post, PM Oli recognized that many Nepalis have become accustomed to cashless transactions for daily financial activities. He expressed concern over the additional fees charged for small transactions, stating, ""Most of us now transfer money digitally, and these extra charges are burdening the public."" The Prime Minister encouraged the public to share their concerns with the government, promising action. ""Keep nudging us, and we will continue to address these issues,"" Oli wrote. Citing an example, Oli referred to a complaint from Abin BK of Jajarkot, who said he spends Rs 2,000 to Rs 2,200 monthly on transaction fees alone, with a charge of Rs 11.30 per transfer. Abin shared, ""I make daily transactions of Rs 50 to Rs 100, about 5-6 times a day, and the fees are eating into my budget."" Currently, mobile banking fees for digital transfers range from Rs 4.52 to Rs 22.60 per transaction, with additional charges for interbank transfers and utility payments. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, these fees have risen as more people switched to digital transactions. Oli highlighted his commitment to addressing the issue by collaborating with the relevant authorities to potentially make small digital transactions free of charge.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 15: Speaker Devraj Ghimire has initiated talks with the chief whips and whips of major political parties to address the ongoing obstruction in the House of Representatives.
The discussion is taking place at the Speaker's office in Singha Durbar. Representatives from the Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Center), Rastriya Swatantra Party, and Rastriya Prajatantra Party are participating.
The issue arose after Speaker Ghimire ruled that the word ""violence,"" used by UML MP Yogesh Bhattarai in the meeting held on September 11, was not unparliamentary. Maoist Center's Chief Whip Hitraj Pandey objected, leading to protests by Maoist MPs and the adjournment of the session.
The Speaker called today's meeting to find a solution and discuss the objections raised by the Maoist Center.

The ruling parties are preparing to either pressurize her into resigning or, if that fails, to remove her from the position with a two-thirds majority in the House. There has been growing criticism from the streets to parliament regarding Rana's failure to adhere to the decorum of her office.
Deputy Speaker Rana, who was nominated to parliament by the opposition party, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), under the indigenous category, courted controversy after a letter dated February 26, 2023, was leaked in July in which she requested the US embassy to expedite the visa process for her entourage to the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women.
Rana has publicly admitted to writing a letter requesting a change in visa dates for certain individuals participating in the UN program, but she claimed on Friday that neither the letter had been registered nor the individuals in question ever reached the US. Nevertheless, the act of writing a letter to the embassy while holding the position of Deputy Speaker has led to criticism that she had failed to uphold the decorum of her position. This situation paints a picture of how high-ranking officials have been lax in their duties, prioritizing personal requests and interests over understanding their roles and limitations.
To restore public faith and trust in democratic governance, it is often considered best for individuals in public office to resign when faced with serious accusations. Such a move not only restores public confidence but also holds public office holders accountable. In Nepal’s case of dwindling public confidence in political parties, such a resignation might also help restore the diminishing trust in parties.
Currently, there is a debate over whether the ruling coalition is genuinely seeking to stabilize and strengthen the system. Many believe that past actions as well as current practices of the two parties in the coalition indicate that they are driven by self-interest rather than a genuine commitment to reform of the system and improvement in the conduct of politicians. 
In the days to come, what roles will the NC and the UML play, and how will they respond as letters from other leaders and officials come to light? On the one hand, many are questioning the ruling alliance's actions, while on the other, the ruling coalition seems to be focused on achieving a majority in the Constitutional Council (CC). 
As per Article 284 of the Constitution, the Council is chaired by the Prime Minister and includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the HoR, the Chairperson of the National Assembly, and the leader of the opposition in the HoR. The CC makes recommendations for the appointment of the Chief Justice, heads of constitutional bodies, and other officials. Currently, the PM is in a minority within the CC under the present configuration.
Prime Minister KP Oli and Speaker Devraj Ghimire were elected as MPs from the UML, while National Assembly Chair Narayan Dahal and opposition leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal were elected from the CPN (Maoist Center). Deputy Speaker Rana is an MP from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP). Both the Maoist Center and the RSP are currently in the opposition.
The Constitution provides that if a proposal to remove either the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker for not adhering to the office's conduct is passed by a two-thirds majority of the entire sitting membership of the HoR, the position can be declared vacant.
Removing Rana is not a hard task for the ruling alliance as the ruling coalition commands 182 seats in the House, just two short of the required number for a two-thirds majority. On June 14, PM Oli secured 188 votes of confidence. Maintaining this majority would make it straightforward to remove Rana from her position as Deputy Speaker.
However, if the removal of Rana is seen merely as a means to adjust the balance of power or stabilize the current coalition rather than to uphold constitutional norms, it could set a troubling precedent and weaken the federal democratic republic.
Such accusations will start being leveled against key state institutions and their members based on parliamentary numbers and the interests of the ruling parties. The parties that are prepared to remove the Deputy Speaker today may use their majority to target the Speaker, the President, or anyone else tomorrow. There is a history of parliament becoming weakened when it acts impulsively and based on numbers.
The impeachment motion against the then Chief Justice Sushila Karki was withdrawn by the lawmakers themselves. Similarly, the impeachment motion filed against another Chief Justice, Cholendra Shumsher Rana, has become moot following the change in the ruling coalition.
The Parliamentary Hearing Committee raised questions about the educational qualifications of the then judge Deepak Raj Joshi, preventing him from becoming the Chief Justice. However, parliament and its committees have failed to investigate his credentials and bring the matter into the legal domain.
The CC's recommendation of Krishna Man Pradhan for the position of Commissioner at the Election Commission was rejected by the Parliamentary Hearing Committee based on complaints. Additionally, no parliamentary committee or state body has deemed it necessary to investigate the allegations against Pradhan.
After shifting power and interests, if individuals are targeted and then discarded by parliament and its committees, although immediate interests may be served, it will have long-term repercussions for the country’s governance system and structure.
However, Deputy Speaker Rana's letter to the US Embassy in Kathmandu is not a trivial matter. Instead of merely using it to adjust the Constitutional Council's numerical balance, attention should be focused on investigating the issue and ensuring that such incidents do not occur in the future.
Not only at the US Embassy in Kathmandu but also among many high-ranking and influential leaders, similar recommendation letters are likely to emerge one after another in the future. In such cases, if action is taken according to official responsibilities and legal frameworks, it will mark the beginning of reform, with action against Rana being a starting point. Otherwise, merely replacing one individual with another for the sake of immediate political interests will not strengthen the system; it will only change the situation without improving the system itself.
Instead of strengthening the pillars of the federal democratic republic—such as parliament, the President, the judiciary, and constitutional bodies—using them for cheap popularity and political gain will weaken them. Creating controversies and manipulating these institutions for personal or party interests will undermine their integrity and effectiveness.

 @RepublicaNepal DHANGADI, Sept 14: Sudurpashchim Province Chief Minister Kamal Bahadur Shah has announced that the budget of the province will be presented on Monday September 16.
At a press conference on Saturday, CM Shah stated that the budget will be introduced on Monday.
He mentioned that the budget for the current fiscal year will be prepared with a general review of the budget previously presented by the former government to the provincial assembly on June 15.
“The budget will be brought in accordance with the constitutional and legal procedures,” Shah said, “Since the previous policies and programs have already been passed by the assembly, the budget will be based on those.”
The previous government, led by CM Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), had presented the budget to the provincial assembly on June 15, but it could not be passed due to changes in the political situation at the center.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 14: Deputy Speaker Indira Rana has clarified the allegations against her regarding a letter allegedly written to the US Embassy requesting a visa interview date for individuals unrelated to her office.
Speaking to journalists after Friday's Constitutional Council meeting, Deputy Speaker Rana said she had discussed the topic of her possible removal with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. “I brought up the matter, and the PM said, 'You are a member of the Constitutional Council. Let's not talk about market rumors. Let's leave market rumors to the market,'"" she said.
She further clarified that the letter had neither reached the embassy nor had the individuals in question traveled to the US. “In fact, the letter hasn't even been registered,” she stated.
Rana also emphasized that, as she had done nothing wrong, she had no intention of resigning.
Parliament and the political landscape are currently embroiled in a heated debate over the letter allegedly sent by Deputy Speaker Rana to the US Embassy in February 2023, requesting visa interview dates for individuals not connected to her official duties.
The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has issued a whip instructing its Members of Parliament (MPs) not to leave the Kathmandu Valley until September 19, while the CPN-UML has called for Rana to resign and make way for a new Deputy Speaker, accusing her of misconduct.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 14: The Public Service Broadcasting Bill has been passed with a provision to merge public communication institutions, Radio Nepal and Nepal Television, deviating from the original aim of making public broadcasting autonomous and impartial.
The Public Service Broadcasting Bill, passed by both houses, is set to be sent to the President for authentication on September 15. The bill will come into effect on the 31st day after authentication.
Although stakeholders suggested that Radio Nepal and Nepal Television should be operated under a single umbrella organization and run on public funds using the 'BBC model,' the Education, Health, and Information Technology Committee proceeded with passing the bill disregarding this recommendation.
This bill merges Radio Nepal and Nepal Television but does not provide for autonomy, which suggests that news reporting will remain in the old style. As a result, these entities may not be able to critically address issues of corruption.
The chairperson of the council to be formed for operating public service broadcasting will be the Minister of Communications or the State Minister for Communications. Since this council will have the authority to provide policy and other necessary directives for public service broadcasting, it is likely to lead to clear interference.
Despite opposition lawmakers' objections that public service broadcasting should not become a government mouthpiece, the bill was passed by a majority. Some ruling party lawmakers also shared the opposition's view that taxpayer-funded institutions should be autonomous.
The bill provides for the selection of the chairperson of the executive committee for public service broadcasting to be made by the Public Service Commission. The chairperson will be appointed based on the recommendations of a recommendation committee chaired by the chairman or a designated member of the Public Service Commission. The recommendation committee will include the Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and a person with at least 10 years of experience in the radio or television sector.
One month after the bill is authenticated, a public call for applications will be made for the position of Executive Chairperson. The selection will be based on the submitted action plan and an interview process. The appointed Executive Chairperson will serve a four-year term. According to the bill, the existing positions at Radio Nepal and Nepal Television will be merged.
Additionally, employees will be provided with voluntary retirement benefits. After the merger of the two institutions, the approved positions from both will be restructured.
The bill also provides for the adjustment of equivalent levels and categories, and allows for voluntary retirement to be granted with the approval of the ministry. Additionally, instead of submitting the annual report to the government, it must now be presented to the relevant committee of the federal parliament.

 @RepublicaNepal BIRATNAGAR, Sept 13: The Nepali Congress (NC) has officially joined the Koshi Province Government with three ministers and one state minister from the party taking the oath of office today.
The NC team, led by Bhupendra Rai, who has been appointed the Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development, includes Bhumi Rajbanshi, who has taken on the role of State Minister for Physical Infrastructure Development. Both are from the Krishna Prasad Sitaula faction of the NC.
Similarly, Khagen Singh Hangam has been appointed as the Minister for Industry, Agriculture, and Cooperatives, while Sadananda Mandal has taken on the role of Minister for Tourism, Forests, and Environment. Hangam is aligned with NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba's faction, whereas Mandal is known to be close to Gyanendra Karki within the establishment faction.
The NC had initially decided to join the government on July 27 but the process was delayed due to the insistence of two ministers from the rival Shekhar Koirala faction. Then, the Koirala faction had demanded two ministries, but the establishment faction offered one minister and one state minister. However, today the party joined the government without the Shekhar Koirala faction.
Nevertheless, NC leaders have indicated that an additional minister and state minister from the party will join the government in the coming days.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 12: Amid preparations by the ruling coalition to oust Deputy Speaker Indira Rana on the grounds of breaching professional conduct, Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Nepal lawmaker Prakash Adhikari has opposed the motion of no confidence against Rana.
Speaking briefly to Republica, Adhikari stated that the idea of ousting Deputy Speaker Rana is not appropriate and will not foster a positive culture in politics. “The party has not made an official decision regarding this issue, but personally, I believe it is not appropriate,” Adhikari said.
He lamented that removing members of the Constitutional Council (CC) to serve vested political interests has become a trend. The ruling alliance is also driven by its political interests to establish a majority in the CC by removing Deputy Speaker Rana from her position, he said.
However, he acknowledged that Rana made a mistake by abusing her power and failing to uphold the integrity of her position. “She should not be forgiven for this,” he added.
Adhikari mentioned that JSP Nepal has yet to make an official decision on this matter, and the party will decide once the ruling alliance finalizes its stance.
The House of Representatives (HoR) is currently experiencing heated debate regarding a letter sent by Deputy Speaker Rana to the U.S. Embassy last year, requesting visa interview dates for individuals unrelated to her official role.
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has already proposed the removal of Deputy Speaker Rana during a meeting of the ruling coalition parties on Monday, and the coalition partners have agreed to the PM’s proposal. 
Following this, the ruling Nepali Congress issued a whip on Wednesday, instructing its lawmakers not to leave the Kathmandu Valley until September 19.
However, another major ruling partner, CPN-UML, has stated that the party is not preparing to oust her. Chief Whip of UML, Mahesh Bartaula, said that Parliament will decide if questions are raised regarding the Deputy Speaker's integrity.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 12: The ruling Nepali Congress (NC) has issued a whip instructing its Members of Parliament (MPs) not to leave the Kathmandu Valley until September 19.
NC Chief Whip Shyam Ghimire informed Republica that the whip had been issued on Wednesday, directing the party’s lawmakers not to travel outside the Kathmandu Valley and those currently outside to return to the federal capital as soon as possible.
The ruling alliance is preparing to oust Deputy Speaker Indira Rana, citing her conduct against the integrity of the position she holds. She is accused of writing a letter to the US Embassy to arrange visa interview dates for five individuals unrelated to her office.
On Wednesday, the NC requested that the Deputy Speaker resign on moral grounds to pave the way for the election of a new Deputy Speaker. It has been reported that if she does not resign, the ruling alliance plans to initiate the process to remove her from the position.
The NC has 88 members in the House of Representatives (HoR).
Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli proposed the removal of Deputy Speaker Rana during a meeting of the ruling coalition parties on Monday. The coalition partners have agreed to the PM’s proposal.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 11: Nepali Congress (NC) has sought the resignation of Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar.
A meeting of NC party top-leaders held on Wednesday concluded that Deputy Speaker Rana Magar had acted inappropriately by writing a letter to the US Embassy for visas of  unrelated individuals and sought the resignation of Rana Magar.
Deputy Speaker Rana Magar had written a letter to the US Embassy in Nepal requesting to expedite the interview of five people for the 67th session of the UN's ‘Commission on the Status of Women’. 
Although the Deputy Speaker Rana Magar had written the letter for four men and one woman,  they were not granted permission to go to the US. The letter, written in February 2023, was recently leaked. Following the leak of the letter, the Deputy Speaker has faced a serious controversy.
The issue of Rana Magar was also discussed during a meeting of coalition partners at the Prime Minister's residence in Baluwatar on Monday evening.
In the parliamentary session held on Tuesday, MPs from both the opposition and the ruling parties stood in support/opposition of Deputy Speaker Rana Magar.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 11: The two major opposition parties in the parliament have warned the government that they will launch protests if the ruling coalition removes Deputy Speaker Indira Rana from her position. They made such remarks after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, in a meeting of top leaders of the ruling alliance held at Baluwatar on Monday,  reportedly proposed filing a removal motion against Rana . 
Speaking at a meeting of the House of Representatives (HoR) on Tuesday, leaders from the main opposition party - the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) took strong exceptions to the alleged move of the ruling parties – the Nepali Congress (NC) and the CPN-UML – to mount pressure on the Rana to resign. 
“If the media reports that deputy speaker Indira Rana is to be removed are true, our party strongly protests and opposes such an action,” Chief whip of the Maoist Center Hit Raj Pandey said during the parliamentary meeting, “The ruling parties need to clarify whether it is planning to make such a move.” 
Deputy speaker Rana, who was nominated to the parliament by the opposition party RSP under the indigenous category, courted controversy after a letter dated February 26, 2023, was leaked in July in which she requested the US embassy to expedite the visa process for her entourage to the 67th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. 
Leaders from the RSP warned the ruling coalition that the party will bring down the government if it initiates the move for . “Discussions among political parties to remove the deputy speaker over an unsubstantiated claim of abuse of authority are unacceptable in democracy,” Chief whip of the RSP Santosh Pariyar said, “The RSP will bring down the ruling coalition with sheer numbers in the streets if it moves forward with such an undemocratic practice.”
Lawmaker Devendra Paudel of the Maoist Center claimed that some ministers of the sitting cabinet would need to resign first if the ethical standard applied to Rana by the ruling parties is applied to all leaders. “If the deputy speaker has to vacate her post on the basis of allegations, the ruling coalition should remember that a number of sitting ministers have also been alleged of involvement in scandals,” he said, “Will the ministers said to be involved in the Bhutanese refugee scandal, Baluwatar land grab and Giribandhu scandal also tender their resignation?” He claimed that the Maoist Center will stand by the deputy speaker amid mounting pressure from the ruling coalition for  her resignation. 
Former Minister for Information and Communications Gokul Baskota urged Rana to step down from her position citing the example of his own resignation following the leak of a sound clip whereby he demanded a bribe of Rs 700 million. “When the character of such an office-bearer is under doubt, the right way out is to prove innocence by stepping down and providing an explanation,” he said during the meeting. Other lawmakers from the CPN-UML including Surya Prasad Dhakal, Shobha Gyawali, Saraswati Subba also demanded Rana’s resignation, warning that if she does not resign, they will be compelled to remove her for not adhering to the conduct expected of her position. 
The HoR witnessed a heated debate regarding the resignation which has been described as a move from the ruling coalition to find a majority in the constitutional council. Currently, three members of the constitutional council, which makes recommendations for appointment and dismissal of the head of various constitutional bodies, are from the opposition parties. The present council comprises of non-partisan Chief Justice Bishowambhar Prasad Shrestha; Chairperson of the National Assembly Narayan Prasad Dahal and Leader of the main opposition party Pushpa Kamal Dahal from Maoist Center; deputy speaker Rana from the RSP; Speaker of the HoR Dev Raj Ghimire from CPN-UML and the president of the council PM Oli.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 10: The parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the misuse of cooperative funds is preparing to submit its report to the House of Representatives on September 20. The committee's tenure lasts until September 22. If the parliamentary session ends before the tenure, the committee will submit the report to Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Since there is no business, there is a possibility that the parliamentary session will end after September 11.
A member of the committee said, ""The work is being done with the aim of submitting the report while the parliamentary session is still ongoing. We are preparing to submit the report by September 20, if possible."" According to sources, the report is being prepared to also implicate former Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the cooperative fraud case. However, the committee member mentioned that no decision has been made on this matter yet. ""If he is accused without evidence, Lamichhane could go to court. He can only be accused based on solid evidence,"" the member said.
On August 23, the committee took a nine-hour statement from Rabi Lamichhane. The statement was taken in his capacity as the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, through which the cooperative funds had been channeled. On September 3, the House of Representatives extended the committee's term by 15 days. The committee had requested an additional 15 days due to insufficient time.
On May 28, the House of Representatives formed a seven-member parliamentary special committee to investigate the misuse of cooperative funds. Initially, the committee was instructed to submit its report within three months from the start date. The committee began its work on June 5.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 10: The CPN (Maoist Center) has stated that they will launch protests if the ruling alliance removes Deputy Speaker Indira Rana from her position.
Speaking during the House of Representatives (HoR) meeting, Maoist Center Chief Whip Hit Raj Pandey expressed the party's opposition to the move to remove Rana.
“If the media reports that Honorable Indira Rana is to be removed are true, our party strongly protests and opposes such an action,” he said. He also urged the ruling parties to clarify the matter.
Earlier, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) opposed the ruling alliance's move to remove Rana. RSP Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar stated that discussions among political parties to remove the Deputy Speaker are unacceptable for democracy.
RSP lawmakers Sumana Shrestha and Sobita Gautam have also urged against discouraging the Deputy Speaker.
Meanwhile, in the HoR meeting, lawmakers from the CPN-UML have demanded the resignation of Deputy Speaker Rana. They have warned that if she does not resign, they will be compelled to remove her for not adhering to the conduct expected of her position.
UML MP Hemraj Rai stated that there should be no compulsion to remove her from the position.
“The Deputy Speaker is a dignified personality in this parliament. It is unfortunate that no clarification has been provided regarding the allegations. If there are issues concerning the Deputy Speaker, the truth should be communicated to parliament. There should be no situation that forces the house to proceed with matters like impeachment,” UML MP Rai said.
Several other UML lawmakers, including Surya Prasad Dhakal, Shobha Gyawali, Saraswati Subba, and others, have also urged Deputy Speaker Rana to facilitate the process by stepping down.
The HoR is witnessing a heated debate regarding the Deputy Speaker’s resignation.
It is reported that in a meeting of top leaders of the ruling alliance held at Baluwatar on Monday, UML Chairman and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli proposed filing an impeachment motion against Rana, and this proposal has been accepted by other ruling partners.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 10: Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has warned that they will engage in street protests if Deputy Speaker Indira Rana is removed from her position.
Speaking during an emergency hour in the House of Representatives (HoR) meeting on Tuesday, RSP Chief Whip Santosh Pariyar said that there have been reports about the removal of Deputy Speaker Rana. He warned that if such an action is taken, the government and ruling party will face street protests.
Pariyar described the removal of Deputy Speaker Rana as a conspiracy against democracy and stated that his party will not accept it. He further indicated that if the ruling parties use their numerical strength to pursue such actions, his party will work to topple those powers and authorities. Pariyar emphasized that if the ruling parties seek to remove Deputy Speaker Rana out of spite against his party, it will not be accepted.
Pariyar also claimed that if efforts are made to remove Deputy Speaker Rana, the general public will take to the streets against the government.

The main gate of the venue has been locked, and strict security measures are in place. Journalists are prohibited from entering the site.
During the meeting, former home minister and RSP Chairman Rabi Lamichhane faced protests from cooperative victims. Upon learning of Lamichhane's visit to Pokhara, these victims gathered outside the Galaxy Banquet, carrying black flags and placards. This led to a significant police presence to manage the demonstration.
Prior to Lamichhane's arrival, protesters had already begun shouting slogans. Despite police efforts to intervene, the cooperative victims continued their protest with black flags and chants right in front of Lamichhane.

 @RepublicaNepal KATHMANDU, Sept 10: The government has announced free medical treatment for two children injured in an explosion at Dandagau of Phalelung Rural Municipality-5, Panchthar.
A cabinet meeting held on Monday decided to cover the treatment costs for Pawan Rai and Dipson Rai, both injured by an abandoned war-era bomb.
Currently, Pawan and Dipson are receiving care at the Burn Hospital in Kirtipur.
The explosion, which occurred on August 29, claimed the lives of 11-year-old Dipson Sawa and two-and-a-half-year-old Prinsa Sawa. The explosion occurred when a handmade socket bomb from the conflict period detonated.
The government also pledged to provide Rs 500,000 in compensation to each family of the deceased.
